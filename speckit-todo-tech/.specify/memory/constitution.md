# Constitution

## Purpose
Build clear, maintainable product slices from spec to implementation with traceable decisions.

## Principles
1. Spec first: every feature starts with an explicit user outcome and acceptance criteria.
2. Small slices: implement in small, testable increments.
3. Accessibility by default: keyboard access, visible focus, semantic controls.
4. Persistence and reliability: user data must survive refresh and fail safely.
5. Visual intent: style must reflect product direction, not generic defaults.

## Workflow
1. Write `spec.md` with goals, scope, requirements, and acceptance criteria.
2. Write `plan.md` mapping architecture and implementation approach.
3. Write `tasks.md` with ordered, verifiable tasks.
4. Implement only what is in scope.
5. Verify feature behavior and accessibility before handoff.

## Quality Gates
- All required files exist in agreed paths.
- Core features pass manual checks.
- No scope drift beyond approved requirements.
